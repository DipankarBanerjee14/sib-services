                    At HRP Management, our values are anchored in contributing to the community and promoting equitable development. We have a dedicated committee for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which was created by our Board of Directors, including Mr. Shyamal Karmakar and Ms. Shreyasee Karmakar.

                    The main belief of our CR policy highlights the essential role of businesses in social upliftment. We have teams of professionals who come together to improve health, education, and welfare while eradicating poverty for underprivileged communities. Although this may seem like just another initiative, it is an integral part of our operations and commitment to societal engagement.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                    We are proud to mention that our CSR committee was an active part of various initiatives that contributed to education, health, and well-being during the 2023-24 period. This step enabled us to support education-focused organizations, healthcare and preventive health programs, skill-building vocational training, and poverty alleviation efforts. At HRP Management, our commitment extends beyond serving clients as we actively strive to create meaningful, lasting change in the communities around us.
